The error you're encountering suggests you're trying to run commands that are typically used in Unix-like environments (e.g., macOS or Linux) on a Windows system, likely using PowerShell or Command Prompt. Here's how to properly set up and use SSH on Windows, including adding an SSH key to your GitLab profile:

### Step 1: Install Git for Windows
Make sure you have Git for Windows installed, which includes Git Bash, a terminal emulator that supports Unix commands.

- Download and install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

### Step 2: Generate an SSH Key
1. **Open Git Bash** (installed with Git for Windows).
2. **Generate the SSH key**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to save the key to the default location and optionally set a passphrase.

### Step 3: Start the SSH Agent
1. **Start the SSH agent** in Git Bash:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```
2. **Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent**:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

### Step 4: Copy the SSH Key to Your Clipboard
1. **Copy the SSH key**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
   ```

### Step 5: Add the SSH Key to Your GitLab Profile
1. **Log in to GitLab**.
2. **Navigate to your profile settings**:
   - Click on your avatar in the upper-right corner and select `Settings`.
3. **Go to the SSH Keys section**:
   - In the left sidebar, click on `SSH Keys`.
4. **Add your SSH key**:
   - In the “Key” field, paste the SSH key you copied earlier.
   - Optionally, add a title to help identify the key.
   - Click the `Add key` button.

### Step 6: Test Your SSH Connection
1. **Test the connection** in Git Bash:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@gitlab.com
   ```
   - If this is your first time connecting, you may see a message asking if you want to continue connecting. Type `yes` and press Enter.
   - You should see a message like: `Welcome to GitLab, @your_username!`

### Troubleshooting
If you're still having issues, here are a few additional tips:
- Ensure that the `ssh-agent` service is running. You can start it manually by running the following in an elevated PowerShell prompt:
  ```powershell
  Start-Service ssh-agent
  ```
- Make sure `ssh-agent` is enabled to start automatically:
  ```powershell
  Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic
  ```

By following these steps using Git Bash on Windows, you should be able to generate, add, and use an SSH key with GitLab without encountering the errors you faced.
